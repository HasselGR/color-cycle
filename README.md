# [Color-Cycle](https://storied-sfogliatella-ff01eb.netlify.app/)

An App designed to cycle and save colors given an initial hexadecimal color and an increase/decrease in each component

## What does it do?

The app is composed of 7 entries:

Both the color and the change values are separated in components of three. Red, Green and Blue respectively. You first need to enter a value for each component (from 0 to FF), the first three create the color, which will be displayed on the box located in the upper right corner. and the last three will dictate how much each component will increase.

Finally, the last entry dictates the frequency a which the value will increase or decrease, in milliseconds.

Once you start the process here is what you can do:

### `Add Current Color to Palette`

Beneath the colored square you will see this button, this will add the color shown currently there to the "Color Palette" box.

####  `-Set Color On Box`

Once you add a color, you will have the option to put that color back into the square, if you want to give it a closer look.

####  `-Delete Color`

As its name says, this will delete this color from the color palette. useful for when you want to compare colors, or discard those you don't like.

####  `-Copy Color`

You can click in the color or the text of one of the added colors to copy it to your clipboard, that way you skip the hassle of highlighting it!

You can only change the entries directly when the process is stopped, but you are able to copy the colors to the clipboard without stopping the process if you wish to do so.
